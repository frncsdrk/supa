  or to keep the locally modified one the given choice will not be delivered to the machine, getting it
  stuck in apt upgrade limbo. In this case the situation has to be resolved manually by SSHing into the machine
  and killing the apt process, then attempting apt upgrade by hand and following the given instructions to fix
  the situation, if necessary.
